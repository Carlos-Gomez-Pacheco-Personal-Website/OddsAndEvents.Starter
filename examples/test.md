create an empty array numberBank to store the numbers entered by the user. When the user submits the form, the addNumber function is called. This function gets the value of the input field, converts it to an integer, and adds it to numberBank. If the input is not a valid number, an alert is displayed.

The updateNumberBank function updates the contents of the output element with the current contents of numberBank.

The sortOne function removes the last element from numberBank and adds it to either the odds or evens array depending on whether it is odd or even. The updateOdds and updateEvens functions update the contents of their respective output elements with the current contents of odds and evens.

The sortAll function sorts all of the numbers in numberBank into either the odds or evens array depending on whether they are odd or even. It then clears out numberBank, updates all three outputs, and displays them.
